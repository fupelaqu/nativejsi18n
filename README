Native JavaScript i18n
======================

## About

nativejsi18n is a lightweight javascript library for providing internationalization to javascript 
from '.properties' files, just like in Java Resource Bundles. 
It loads and parses resource bundles (.properties).
Resource bundles are '.properties' files containing locale specific key-value pairs. 
The use of '.properties' files for translation is specially useful when sharing i18n files between Java and Javascript projects.
